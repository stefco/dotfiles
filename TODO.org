* To Do

Features I would like to add.

** Bash

*** DONE Rewrite quicklook script in python
    CLOSED: [2017-09-25 Mon 12:25]

Actual solution was to just let the `ql` script handle reopening iterm.

*** TODO Add bash completion to ~nd~; see [[http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/tabexpansion.html][these instructions]].

*** TODO Set up mail attachment viewing capabilities
**** Use [[http://sand.truman.edu/~dbindner/guide/x2059.htm][.mailcap]] to specify scripts/executables
**** Use a [[https://gist.github.com/Integralist/cc2616ece918fdd8239d16cca62e37de][script]] for some further sorting, like quicklook stuff maybe

** Vim

*** TODO add git bindings for grep and search that match the other ones
    basically, make it SPC {b,f,fr,g}{f,g}{s,c,g}
*** TODO add spacemacs keybindings for quitting, deprecate SPC w misuse.
    #+BEGIN-SRC bash
    ## Quit
    SPC q q	Quit Emacs and kill the server, prompt for changed buffers to save
    SPC q Q	Quit Emacs and kill the server, lose all unsaved changes.
    SPC q r	Restart both Emacs and the server, prompting to save any changed buffers
    SPC q s	Save the buffers, quit Emacs and kill the server
    SPC q z	Kill the current frame
    #+END-SRC
*** TODO fix mnemonic mappings for grepping open buffers
    Need to find an alternative to Ack. Probably use [[https://github.com/vim-scripts/GrepCommands][GrepCommands]].
*** DONE Add mnemonic mappings for file opening
    CLOSED: [2017-09-25 Mon 15:46]
    Follows this heirarchy of decisions:

    The ultimate tree of bindings is {b,f,fr}{g,f}{s,c,g}, i.e. 18 combos.

    The ~cursor~ mappings requre different implementations for normal and visual
    mode, so these need two bindings; hence a total of 24 bindings.

**** Buffer or file?
***** grep or find? (grep searches contents, find searches names of bufs/files)
      [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11975174/how-do-i-search-the-open-buffers-in-vim][You can use Ack for this]].
****** Recursive or flat? (file only, leading to b, f, or fr branches)
******* Search, cursor, or go?
******** ~search~
         opens a search window for this type of query and lets the user type
******** ~cursor~
         uses the current selection or word under cursor to prepopulate the search bar,
         but lets the user confirm or modify before confirming
******** ~go~
         the "i'm feeling lucky" of these nav mnemonics. Same as ~cursor~, but hits <CR>
         for you on the assumption that the first result will be good.

*** DONE Add a nerdtree feature for previewing image files with imgcat
    CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 14:04]

** Vim + IPython

*** TODO Add an async thread to ipython
    ...that listens for a file and runs it in ipython when it is written to, then
    appends output to it (or somehow alerts vim to the result)
*** TODO Add vim binding that writes to a file that IPython is watching (easy)
*** TODO Print history on demand from vim for a given profile
*** TODO Use BFG to remove my email from dotfiles
    Make it marginally less easy for spammers to find my shit
*** DONE Add ipython profiles with some nice env checks to make em portable
    CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 14:07]
*** Add some vim features:
**** TODO Add TeX-to-unicode
**** TODO Add vim-orgmode, maybe
     Forget this for now. Too much trouble and spacemacs works just fine. But would
     be nice to have eventually.
**** DONE Add better python indentation
     CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 14:08]
**** DONE Add some markdown mode regexs for better indentation
     CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 14:08]
*** Add a CLI tool for managing my environment and dev repos
**** TODO Add environment syncing CLI utils
***** DONE fetch (from origin)
      CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 14:11]
***** DONE pull (checkout latest)
      CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 14:11]
***** DONE cd (pushd to this directory)
      CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 14:11]
***** TODO status
***** TODO diff
***** TODO commit
***** TODO push
***** TODO clone
****** TODO try github by default
****** TODO try stefco by default
****** TODO try ssh by default, fall back to https on error
****** TODO can specify a full url
**** TODO Should also be possible to specify files using globs
**** TODO Add option to recursively act on git submodules
*** DONE Add a cronscripts directory
    CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 14:12]
*** DONE Add software I use in a "submodules" subdir as git submodules
    CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 14:12]
** Mail (Mutt, Offlineimap, Notmuch, etc.)

*** TODO Find a nicer binding than <F8> for notmuch search.
*** TODO Find a nicer binding than <F9> for notmuch thread reconstruction.
*** TODO Find a binding for Archive Thread
*** TODO Make a binding that sends a thread to "scratch" dir
    Would be nice to use this with notmuch, since those searches happen in a
    virtual mailbox dir.
**** TODO Copy an individual email
**** TODO Copy an entire thread
*** TODO Rename local maildirs to make them more friendly
    These mangled names like [Gmail].Sent are horrid. Must find a way to use
    nametrans in ~offlineimap~ to fix this.
**** TODO Figure out how to do this renaming without forcing massive resyncs.
     Offlineimap seems to have some internal DB that does not pay attention do
     dir renames (fair enough). There must be some way to inform this DB of
     changes to local dirnames so that it does not try to redownload entire
     directories just because the nametrans changes.
**** TODO Come up with replacement names and implement them in nametrans.
