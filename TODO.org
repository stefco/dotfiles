* To Do

Features I would like to add.

** Bash

*** DONE Rewrite quicklook script in python
    CLOSED: [2017-09-25 Mon 12:25]

Actual solution was to just let the `ql` script handle reopening iterm.

*** TODO Add bash completion to ~nd~; see [[http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/tabexpansion.html][these instructions]].

*** TODO Set up mail attachment viewing capabilities
**** Use [[http://sand.truman.edu/~dbindner/guide/x2059.htm][.mailcap]] to specify scripts/executables
**** Use a [[https://gist.github.com/Integralist/cc2616ece918fdd8239d16cca62e37de][script]] for some further sorting, like quicklook stuff maybe

** Vim
*** DONE Add a nerdtree feature for previewing image files with imgcat
    CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 14:04]

** Vim + IPython

*** TODO Add an async thread to ipython
...that listens for a file and runs it in ipython when it is written to, then
       appends output to it (or somehow alerts vim to the result)
*** TODO Add vim binding that writes to a file that IPython is watching (easy)
*** TODO Print history on demand from vim for a given profile
*** TODO Use BFG to remove my email from dotfiles
Make it marginally less easy for spammers to find my shit
*** DONE Add ipython profiles with some nice env checks to make em portable
    CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 14:07]
*** Add some vim features:
**** TODO Add TeX-to-unicode
**** TODO Add vim-orgmode, maybe
Forget this for now. Too much trouble and spacemacs works just fine. But would
be nice to have eventually.
**** DONE Add better python indentation
     CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 14:08]
**** DONE Add some markdown mode regexs for better indentation
     CLOSED: [2017-09-24 Sun 14:08]
