# TODO

Some features I would like to add.

- [ ] Use BFG to remove my email from dotfiles to make it marginally less easy
      for spammers to find my shit
- [ ] Add ipython profiles with some nice env checks to make em portable
- [ ] Add some vim features:
      - [ ] Add TeX-to-unicode
      - [ ] Add vim-orgmode, maybe
      - [ ] Add better python indentation
      - [ ] Add some markdown mode regexs for better indentation
- [ ] Add a CLI tool for managing my environment and dev repos
      - [ ] Should be able to do the following for dotfiles and ergodox using
            partial completion (only executes in unambiguous matching cases):
            - [ ] fetch (from origin)
            - [ ] pull (checkout latest)
            - [ ] cd (pushd to this directory)
            - [ ] status
            - [ ] diff
            - [ ] commit
            - [ ] push
            - [ ] save (add all changes, commit, and push)
      - [ ] Should also be possible to specify files using globs
- [ ] Add a cronscripts directory
