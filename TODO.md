# TODO

Some features I would like to add.

- [ ] Use BFG to remove my email from dotfiles to make it marginally less easy
      for spammers to find my shit
- [ ] Add ipython profiles with some nice env checks to make em portable
- [ ] Add some vim features:
      - [ ] Add TeX-to-unicode
      - [ ] Add vim-orgmode, maybe
      - [ ] Add better python indentation and syntax-highlighting
