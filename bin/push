Usage: push repo1 [ repo2 ... repoN ]

Go to each directory and try to push changes using `git push`. If data cannot
be pushed, just move on to the next directory.

Bookmarks can be used (as defined by the `nd`, navigate directory, command),
though if the repo name can also be interpreted as a valid relative path to
a directory, an attempt will be made to `git push` from that directory first.

This script is not very smart and will just exit on any error.
