Usage: ql_downloader user@host :path1 [ :path2 ... :pathN ] __EndOfFile__

This script downloads files from user@host to ~/.ql_caches/host/path, creating
a partial copy of the filesystem tree on the remote host that can be used for
things like previewing files with quicklook. It also strips the `__EndOfFile__`
delimiter that is required at the end of the argument list for iTerm2 triggered
commands due to the way that iTerm2 processes quoted arguments. It is not meant
to be used interactively. All arguments passed must be absolute paths! No
relative paths or user home directories may be used.

Logs will be stored in ~/.ql_caches/log
